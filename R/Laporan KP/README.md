This is the report of my Kerja Praktik in my fourth to fifth semester at Dinas Pendidikan, Pemuda, dan Olahraga Provinsi DI Yogyakarta. 
This research was conducted using high school PPDB data and vocational schools in DI Yogyakarta Province. The variables analyzed involve 
aspects such as where the student lives, gender, and ASPD (Asesmen Standarisasi Pendidikan Daerah) score. Decision Tree classification
The C5.0 algorithm method is used to identify patterns and relationships between variables
at the student's choice. This research can contribute to understanding
more in-depth regarding the factors that influence students' decisions in selecting
secondary schools, and can be a basis for educational decision making in
policy level. Thus, it is hoped that the results of this research can help
improving the quality of education in DI Yogyakarta Province and providing direction for
students in choosing an educational path that suits their potential and goals.
