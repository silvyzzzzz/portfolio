# About Me
Hello! My name is Silvy Aqila Maharani, you can call me Silvy. I'm 20 years old. I am a third-year student at Universitas Gadjah Mada majoring in Statistics. 
Currently, I am also a Machine Learning Cohort in Bangkit Academy 2024 Batch 1. I am interested in data because we can get so many insights from it. 
I am also interested in project management, risk management, and product development. I like discussions to see other people's various points of view. 
I have much curiosity, so I often get immersed in many fields to gain knowledge, even if it is for fun.
